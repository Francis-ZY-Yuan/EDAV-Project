# Conclusion

We have investigate the relationship between individual attributes and attitudes towards environmental issues.
Main conclusions are the followings:

- Age, income, educations, and sex are related with opinions on a wide range of environmental issues such as 
whether human activities contribute to global climate change or 
whether we should have more nuclear power uses.
The existence or the direction of impact can be different (asymmetric) by each parties.

- Republicans are not only likely to attribute climate change to natural phenomenon but also they are less likely to observe climate change affecting their communities in the first place.
Therefore, we should first review research regarding the existence of impact of climate change on our communities.

- 

- Environmental issues are may be (will be) highly influential to national elections in recent years (in the future).
