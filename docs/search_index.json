[["index.html", "Political views and their attributes Chapter 1 Introduction", " Political views and their attributes Zhenyu Yuan and Yuki Ikeda 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Recently, environmental issues such as SDGs or ESG are becoming more vital for our societies. They are now important not just by scientific means but also from economic points of view and thus political points of view, too. If we pursue to work on some environmental issue, we must have support from the large society and thus understand how people think of those issues, which is very challenging. As an illustration, the world found that there was a wide range of opinion in USA regarding the global climate change, especially when the Tramp administration announced the withdrawal from Paris Agreement in 2017. Considering a wide variety of US citizens who have different scientific, economic and political views, it is worth exploring the existence of some relationship between attributes of individuals and their opinions to consider effective policies on environmental issues. In this exploratory data analysis (EDVA), we want to deepen such kind of insights given in the report by the Pew Research Center: https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/11/25/u-s-public-views-on-climate-and-energy/ Specifically, based on these analysis and the dataset, we work on the following questions. Although the survey pointed out supported parties as a relevant factor, are educations or incomes also related to the opinion toward climate change issues (ex. whether the climate change is due to human activities or just natural patterns in global climate)? We address this issue upon trying to control other relevant effects such as supported parties. From the survey, it is seen that Democrats are more likely to say that the federal government is doing too little for key aspects of the environment, and Democrats are more likely to think the climate change is due to human activities. With respect to this, are Democrats (Republicans) also more (less) recognizing that the climate changes are affecting their local communities (no matter what the reason of the change is) in the first place? We address this issue upon trying to control other relevant effects such as regions. From the survey, it is seen that majority of people think that they should decrease the oil drilling or coal mining, and they should increase natural electricity generations such as one by wind or land heat. However, their opinion is separate with respect to whether they should increase the new clear power plants (Yes:49% vs No:49%). Here, how do factors (sex, age, party, income, regions,…) relate to the choice Yes and No. The survey also includes some questions about the respondents’ personality such as being organized or intellectual. How is personality affecting one’s attitude towards climate changes and willingness to take actions to reduce climate change? Has the public’s attitude towards climate change evolved over time? Does this change correlate with the change in election outcomes? Is it different across regions and groups? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 American Trends Panel (ATP) by the Pew Research Center 2.2 US Election Data 2.3 How to answer the questions above using the data", " Chapter 2 Data sources In this analyses, we use the following two kinds of datasets. 2.1 American Trends Panel (ATP) by the Pew Research Center https://www.pewresearch.org/american-trends-panel-datasets/ Wave 33 (Apr 2018), Wave 55 (Oct 2019), and Wave 67 (Apr 2020) The Pew Research Center has been conducting nationwide randomized surveys on social issues for many years. Questions related to environmental issues include: The climate change is due to human activities or just natural patterns in global climate. The federal government is doing too little for key aspects of the environment. We should decrease oil drilling/ coal mining. We should increase natural sources of electricity generations. We should increase nuclear power plants. It also includes basic attributes of respondents such as age, sex, political party, region, education and income, which enables us to connect those basic attributes to their opinion. The sample size is large enough (Wave 33:2541, Wave 55:3627, and Wave 67:10957), and so is the number of variables (all of them include 100+ questions). Since it has weights assigned to each sample in order to modify the imbalance of attributes of respondents compared to some benchmark sources such as Gender 2017 American Community Survey, we can present unbiased aggregated figures. Climate change is a frequent topic in the ATP, so we can make comparison over time. (A note: since respondents to different surveys are not the same, it’s an aggregation of cross-sectional data instead of panel data.) 2.2 US Election Data https://www.fec.gov/introduction-campaign-finance/election-and-voting-information/ This is released by the Federal Election Commission and contains each state’s votes to each candidate in each federal election. 2.3 How to answer the questions above using the data For question 1-4, we only use the data Wave 55 (Oct 2019), since we wanted to start with the latest dataset for the pre-pandemic USA. We suspect that the pandemic has drastically changed a nature of environmental issues; i.e., they have the potential to bring a number of jobs to recover the economy rapidly. Thus, the potentially more complicated analysis for the midst or post pandemic world remains for future study. For question 1, the existing report above suggests the strong relationship between a party one supports and his/her opinion. Hence, we should control parties, when we conduct an analysis for this question. Here, this data is useful since we can calculate for each party whether there is a firm relationship of opinion toward each climate change issue with their incomes or educations. For question 2, the existing report above suggests people living in the Pacific region are more likely to experience some climate change. Here, it is known that there are more Democrats in the Pacific region. Hence, we should control regions, when we conduct an analysis for this question. This is where this data comes in since for every region we can calculate the proportions of those who are recognizing that the climate change is affecting their community among each party, comparing the proportions of the two parties in each region. For question 1 and 2, we can also perform the statistical test of the difference of ratios. For question 3, we can calculate and compare the proportions of Yes and No for each candidate factor such as sex, age, party, income and regions. We can also conduct the chi-squared t tests to add independent analyses. For question 4, we will investigate the relationship between the average number of actions to protect environment and personalities (being organized or intellectual) for each strength of recognition of impact of global climate change on one’s community. For question 5, we additionally use the US election (2018) data, Waves 33 and Wave 67. Since Waves 33 and Wave 67 are conducted on elections years, we can relate them with the outcomes of the elections. We can use a difference-in-difference method to check whether there’s a correlation between the change in attitude towards climate change and the change in election outcomes. This is the most original and promising one in this EDVA analyses, since today “SDGs,” “EGS” and other topics relating to environmental protection have become so popular that such matters can also affect the global economy and can even decide the winner or loser of national elections. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this chapter, we briefly explain the data transformation process for exploratory analyses with R. Since, the data is already well-formatted as .sav files, we only imported them into dataframes and only rendered some factor re-labeings or re-namings after analyzing the missing value patterns. Note that our data have weights which correct the potential bias of the attributes of the respondents of the questionnaires based on some other referenced large data. All the results in the existing report is based on those weights. Therefore, we should also consider those weights when we aggregate samples into graphs. However, for the following reasons, we employ simple aggregation for Question 1-3 (that is, just by simply counting the number of samples in the raw data, instead of aggregating the weights attached on the raw data). Question 4-5 are based on the resampling method written below. Many EDVA packages including those we used in this analyses cannot deal with data with weights. Hence, it requires quite additional work. Although one way to overcome this is to resample the raw data with sampling probabilities proportional to those weights. However, it would fairly augment the raw data already not small (about from 4,000 to 10,000 rows with tens of columns for each dataset) if we try to ensure that the sampling error would be minimized, which was difficult for one of us due to the limited performance of his PC. We have confirmed that there are no fatal discrepancies (that would change the conclusion) between the weighted aggregated results given in the existing report and our simply aggregated one given here. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Respondents’ attributes for Questions 1-3 4.2 Question 1 4.3 Question 2 4.4 Question 3", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this chapter, we investigate the missing or DK(Don’t know)/Refuse patterns in the following. To this end, we use an originally coded plot missing function. Here, as a conclusion, even though there are small number of refused answers, there are no truly NA values (here truly NA values mean that we even do not know whether the respondent refused to answer, or the respondent was eager to answer but we simply failed to record it). Hence, we drop all the refused variables hereafter. Nevertheless, we left the following explanation for illustrations that can be potentially applied to other EDVA analyses. Specifically, it includes the concept of MAR or MCAR which is crucial for giving unbiased estimate for a ground average based on data including missing values. 4.1 Respondents’ attributes for Questions 1-3 From Q1 to Q3, we use the following variables as respondents’ attributes: F_METRO: Whether they live in metropolitan area or not F_CDIVISION: Their regions F_AGECAT: their age categories F_SEX: their sex F_EDUCCAT: their education levels F_MARITAL: their marital status F_PARTYSUM_FINAL: their supporting parties F_INCOME: their income categories Actually, there are no missing values other than “DK/Refuse” in these attributes. The “DK/Refuse” patterns are as the following where the purple tiles represent them. It is consistent with out intuition that the largest DK/Refuse patterns are for F_INCOME and F_PARTYSUM_FINAL. Note that there are no large refused patterns which might affect our analyses in any variables. If these DK/Refuse patterns were large, we would have to check whether the answers for questionnaires of interest are not severely unbiased for the DK/Refuse patterns. 4.2 Question 1 For Q1, we use the the questions below: EN7_W55: How much do you think human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels, contributes to global climate change? EN8_W55: How much do you think natural patterns in the Earth’s environment contribute to global climate change? Similarly to the attribute information, there are no missing values but there are “refuse” answers. The refusal patterns for these questions are presented below. Note that the explanatory variable are written in uppercase letter, while the explained ones in lowercase. Like the one for respondents’ attributes, there are no large refusal patterns. Also, there are no prominent refusal correlations that we should pay attention to, since the largest refusal patterns have only one refused item. Hence, we drop all the refused variables (now having been replaced into “NA”) hereafter. 4.3 Question 2 For CLIM9F1 (for Form 1) and F2 (for Form 2), the questions are as below: How much, if at all, do you think global climate change is currently affecting… CLIM9F1_a_W55: The United States (1 A great deal, 2 Some, 3 Not too much, 4 Not at all) CLIM9F1_b_W55: Your local community (1 A great deal, 2 Some, 3 Not too much, 4 Not at all) CLIM9F2_W55: How much, if at all, do you think global climate change is currently affecting your local community? Questions from CLIM10_a_W55 to CLIM10_g_W55 are asked for respondents who answered 1 or 2 for CLIM9F1_b_W55 or CLIM9F2_W55. The alternatives are either 1 or 2: 1 Yes, a major way, 2 No, not a major way CLIM10_a_W55: Droughts or water shortages CLIM10_b_W55: Long periods of unusually hot weather CLIM10_c_W55: Severe weather, like floods or intense storms CLIM10_d_W55: Rising sea levels that erode beaches and shore lines CLIM10_e_W55: Damage to forests and plant life CLIM10_f_W55: Harm to animal wildlife and their habitats CLIM10_g_W55: More frequent wildfires One can see from below that in Form 1, CLIM9F1_a_W55, CLIM9F1_b_W55 are not missing, Likewise, CLIM9F2_W55 is not missing for Form 2. Also, it is confirmed from below that the questions CLIM10_X_W55 for X=a,…,g are missing only if CLIM9F1_b_W55 or CLIM9F2_W55 is answered by 3 Not too much, 4 Not at all, or “Refused.” Therefore, the only essential missing values of CLIM10_X_W55 is the one when comm or comm2 is “Refused” or when they are “Refused” by themselves. ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## # Groups: comm, comm2 [6] ## comm comm2 water `n()` ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Not too much &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 402 ## 2 Not at all &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 208 ## 3 Refused &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 10 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; Not too much &lt;NA&gt; 437 ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; Not at all &lt;NA&gt; 272 ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; Refused &lt;NA&gt; 14 We then investigate the refusal patterns here. Although it is seen that the number of missing rows is small enough to dismiss, let’s discuss in more detail. From the refusal patterns plot below, the most frequent refusal pattern is refusals for all variables. It is suspected that the reason for this is that answering them was felt like time-consuming and bothering because of (1) or (2) below: their personality (not relating to their answers) the respondents were not sure about or did not know a concrete impact of climate change on any of the items. In the case of (1), the missing pattern is probably “missing completely at random (MCAR)” or “missing at random (MAR),” since in this case their personality is independent of the answers for CLIM10_X_W55 (impact on one’s community). For the other top refusal patterns where only one variable is refused, it is more strongly suspected that the respondents did not know whether there were an impact on the particular item. Hence, hereafter we can rationally assume either (1) the missing pattern is either MCAR or MAR or (2) the refused answers for these questions imply “2 No, not a major way.” In the case of (1), it is known that the relationship of explanatory variables and explained one (more precisely, the least squared estimator of the slope for a true linear model) can be inferred unbiasedly. Similar argument holds at least qualitatively for discrete explanatory variables. In the case of (2), the missing values are no longer missing (they are “2 No”). Therefore, it suffices to simply compute the proportion of “1 Yes, a major way” to all non-missing values and analyse the difference in the proportions between supporting parties to answer Q2. We therefore will drop all refused variables henceforth with some factor relabeling. 4.4 Question 3 For Q3, we use the questions below about agreeing or disagreeing with more nuclear power plants to generate electricity. ENV2_a_W55: More offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters ENV2_b_W55: More nuclear power plants to generate electricity ENV2_c_W55: More coal mining ENV2_d_W55: More solar panel “farms” ENV2_e_W55: More hydraulic fracturing, sometimes called “fracking,” for oil and natural gas ENV2_f_W55: More wind turbine “farms” Similarly to the attribute information, there are no missing values but there are “refuse” answers. Those refusal patterns are presented below for questions including others such as more coal mining or more natural energy. Note that the explanatory variable are written in uppercase letter, while the explained ones in lowercase. Like the one for respondents’ attributes, there are no large refusal patterns. It is interesting that the most major refusal pattern is not the one in which all of them are refused, but only one of them is refused. Combining with the fact that the user interface of these questions in the questionnaire displays only “favor” or “oppose” options, it implies that the “refusal” means “Do not have opinion” rather than “Do not want to answer” or “refuse to answer (due to some personal reason).” Hence, even if the proportion of refusal is larger, these refusal pattern will not make the aggregated proportion biased at least severely. Although it is of interest to investigate whether these refusal patterns are correlated with some attributes of the respondents, the small number of the refusal sample size makes it difficult to analyse. Also, there are no prominent refusal correlations that we should pay attention to, since the largest refusal patterns have only one refused item. Hence, we drop all the refused variables (now having been replaced into “NA”) hereafter. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Question 1 5.2 Question 2 5.3 Question 3 5.4 Question 4 5.5 Question 5", " Chapter 5 Results Please note that here we simply refer to those who support the Republican party by simply “Republicans” and the Democratic Party by “Democrats.” We tried the chi-squared independence test for every result given here. Due to the large sample (N~3600), unless otherwise stated, a visible relationship in a mosaic plot almost surely meant a rejection of the null hypotheses of independence at least in this analysis with p-values less than around 5%. On the other hand, not clear relationship in a mosaic plot sometimes also led to a rejection in this analysis with the same p-value range. 5.1 Question 1 We first explore the answer to the following question: Q1. Although the survey pointed out supported parties as a relevant factor, are educations or incomes also related to the opinion toward climate change issues (ex. whether the climate change is due to human activities or just natural patterns in global climate)? We address this issue upon trying to control other relevant effects such as supported parties. To see this, noting that the existing report suggests the strong relationship between a party one supports and his/her opinion. Hence, we should control parties, when we conduct an analysis for this question. Hence, we drew some mosaic plots of opinion to climate change issues with faceting supported parties (Democratic and Republican) for several candidate of attributes. Among them, we recognized a relationship between age categories and the opposition to nuclear power uses. Here, we restricted to one of the most main topics of this survey, that is, whether human activities contribute to the climate change. As a result, we recognized some attributes relating to the opinion. The first one is age: As seen from the plot above, while age is not likely to have a clear relationship for Democrats, younger Republicans are more likely to think humans are responsible for the climate change . It is of interest that what the reason is. There are several candidate factors to explain this. There are many hypotheses that tried demystifying the reason such as overlap with the serge of international discussion on climate change and their puberty, or they have high interest because they have to live longer from now. For more detail, see this (Columbia Climate School): https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/02/04/age-gap-environmental-politics/ Actually, this result is quite consistent with the results written in the URL above. Another finding is that most of people (almost 80-90%) think human activities more or less contribute to the global climate change. The difference is on the degree of impacts. The next relevant attribute that we have found is income: Here, we see the contrasting results for the both parties, which is really interesting. Democrats with higher or middle income are more likely to think human activities contribute to more, while Republicans with higher or middle income are less likely to do. Since income and education levels are correlated, it would not be surprising if we had such an opposite tendencies on the education level, too. However, since the tendency is not so clear for Republicans on education (see the chi-squared independence tests below), we suspect that there may be some unique reason for the relationship with income, and it is not just that education is a confounding factor. Therefore, it is worth investigating more. chi-squared independence test for income levels and the degree human activities contribute to for only Republicans: we reject the null hypothesis that both are independent. ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: A ## X-squared = 38.882, df = 24, p-value = 0.0281 chi-squared independence test for education levels and the degree human activities contribute to for only Republicans: we cannot reject the null hypothesis that both are independent. ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: A ## X-squared = 7.1966, df = 6, p-value = 0.3031 The last relevant factor is sex: Although the difference itself is relatively small, it is quite interesting that male are a little more likely to think that human activities contribute to the climate change, but opposite for Republicans. Actually, it is consistent with the proportion of opposition to coal mining (see Question 3), which may mean that male Democrats are little more likely to affirmative to the environmental protection. ## ## Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test ## ## data: A ## X-squared = 20.829, df = 3, p-value = 0.0001143 Lastly, we did not detect any relevant relationship with (1) regions, (2) whether one lives in metropolitan area or not, or (3) marital status, thereby omitted the results. 5.2 Question 2 Q2. From the survey, it is seen that Democrats are more likely to say that the federal government is doing too little for key aspects of the environment, and Democrats are more likely to think the climate change is due to human activities. With respect to this, are Democrats (Republicans) also more (less) recognizing that the climate change is affecting their local communities (no matter what the reason of the change is) in the first place? We address this issue upon trying to control other relevant effects such as regions. The existing report above suggests people living in the Pacific region are more likely to experience some climate change. Here, it is known that there are more Democrats in the Pacific region. Hence, we should control regions, when we conduct an analysis for this question. Specifically, for every region we calculated the proportions of those who are recognizing that the climate change is affecting their community among each party, comparing the proportions of the two parties in each region. Hence, we drew again some mosaic plots representing the proportions of recognizing that the climate change is affecting their local communities. There are two types of flows of questions in the user interface of the survey. Thus, there are two types of variables that represent the proportions. However, since both ended up with similar results, we present only one as below: One can see in every region, there are large difference between the two parties of the proportion of the extent to which the climate change is affecting their communities. It implies that not only Republicans are likely to attribute climate change to natural phenomenon but also they are less likely to observe climate change affecting their communities in the first place. Hence, there are composite reasons yielding the difference of attitude towards climate change between those parties. We think that the question whether climate change is affecting our communities is easier to handle than the one whether climate change is heavily due to human activities or not if any. Therefore, this result tells us that we should first review research regarding the existence of impact of climate change on our communities, and if any, that would be the start point to discuss the impact of human activities on climate change. This is where Data Science comes in since it essentially requires statistical points of view. In this regard, lastly we want to point out that there are both types of climate change that have relatively small or large differences in proportions between the two parties. Specifically, (1) more frequent wildfires, (2) rising sea levels, and (3) water shortages have relatively smaller differences, while (4) harm to animal wildlife and their habitats and (5) damage to forests and plant life have larger ones (probably since they are not so familiar affairs to our daily lives) as seen from the two illustrative plots below. Thus, reviewing research regarding the latter ones are considered to be of high priorities. 5.3 Question 3 Q3. From the survey, it is seen that majority of people think that they should decrease the oil drilling or coal mining, and they should increase natural electricity generations such as one by wind or land heat. However, their opinion is separate with respect to whether they should increase the new clear power plants (Yes:49% vs No:49%). Here, how do factors (sex, age, party, income, regions,…) relate to the choice Yes and No. To see this, we can calculate and compare the proportions of Yes and No for each candidate factor such as sex, age, party, income and regions. We can also conduct the chi-squared t tests to add independent analyses. Actually, we saw that supporting parties are highly related to the opposition rates. Higher for Democrats, and lower for Republicans. Hence, similarly to Q1, we drew some mosaic plots with faceting supported parties (Democratic and Republican) for several candidate of attributes. Among them, we recognized a relationship between some attributes and the opposition to nuclear power uses. The first one is age categories similarly to Question 1. As seen from the graph, Democrats have higher average level of opposition rate to nuclear uses than Republicans. It is interesting that while people who support Democrats have similar opposition rates over all age categories, for those who support Republican, younger ones have higher opposition rates. In fact, the same tendencies are observed from any other energy resources no matter they have lower opposition rate (solar power use) or higher one (coal mining) in average. This may mean that younger people are not only humans are responsible for the climate change (Question 1), but also are more likely to have interest in protection of environment. Republican party should pay attention to whether younger Republican will become more favor to nuclear uses, or their opinion will not change in the future. The next relevant attribute is income (or education) levels. As seen from above, while income levels are not clearly related to opposition rates for Democrats, there seems to be a decreasing relationship for Republicans. As income and education levels are correlated, we see the similar relationship for education level, too. However, we are not sure whether the education level is a confounding factor or not, since it is difficult to come up with the reason why higher education drives only Republicans (not Democrats) to be in favor of nuclear power use more. Perhaps, their professions have something to do with their views on environmental issue, which cannot be answered since there are no information for their professions in the survey. Here is one of the limitation of our EDVA, but it can be a motivation for other research or policies. The last relevant attribute is sex. As seen from the plot below, there are relatively large difference between sex. Note that since some people think that nuclear power is useful to decrease the coal or oil mining and therefore effective to protect natural environment. The result above may signify that men are more like to think that way than women. Indeed, comparing this result with the one for coal mining, male Democrats seem to be willing to protect the environment no less than female Democrats, which is probably consistent with the result of the recognition of impacts of human activities in Question 1 as we mentioned earlier. Though we do not show here, we observed very similar result for oil-gas mining, too. Lastly, we did not detect any relevant relationship with (1) regions, (2) whether one lives in metropolitan area or not, or (3) marital status, thereby omitted the results. 5.4 Question 4 Besides people’s perception of climate and environment problems, it’s important to know how willing are they to take actions to tackle those problems. (After all, actions speak louder than words.) In an survey conducted by the Pew center in 2019, people were asked if they would do things in their daily life to protect the environment. Specifically, the questions are: To simplify the analysis, we aggregated the answers to those 5 questions and excluded all answers of refusal. We generate a new variable EnvActCount that equals the number of yes answers to the five questions. First, let’s see the overall distribution. We can see that Americans are generally willing to take some action to protect the environment: more than half are willing to do at least three of the five in their daily life. What’s more interesting is the factors affecting this. Naturally, we assume if someone fells his community is suffering from environmental problems, he would be more willing to take actions to combat them. This is confirmed by the data. (Note: in the questionnaire, the question asked was “How much, if at all, do you think global climate change is currently affecting your local community”, which isn’t exactly about the environment, but it’s reasonable to use that as a proxy.) Indeed, if people think their community is more affected, they are more willing to take actions themselves to counter the effect. Though the wordings Not too much and Some sound similar, the order in the plot represents the order those options are presented in the questionnaire, so respondents would naturally perceive them are ordered as Not at all, Not so much, Some, A great deal. An even more interesting question is whether certain personality traits affect people’s willingness to take those actions. In the questionnaire, people were asked to rate themselves on the following scales from 1 to 5: - Extroverted to Introverted - Hard-working to Lazy - Conventional thinker to Creative thinker - Calm to Nervous - Outgoing to Shy - Impulsive to Self-disciplined - Sympathetic to Unsympathetic - Disorganized to Organized - Analytical to Not analytical - Relaxed to Tense - Accepting of others to Critical of others - Intellectual to Not intellectual Self ratings on each of the scales has significant correlation with EnvActCount. This is not surprising since the sample size is large. Here we are presenting the most interesting results. We decided to control for people’s perception of the effect of climate change, because it is affected by people’s personalities, and we want to capture the direct effect of personality. Disorganized people tend to be more willing to act on climate change, even if they don’t feel their community is affected much. This is worth investigating since the difference is significant, while there’s no clear explanation for this. Intellectual people’s willingness to act to protect the environment is more determined by their perception of how serious the problem is. A side note: though some of traits sound disapproving (e.g. disorganized), the number of people that identify themselves as of these traits aren’t small, so this won’t affect the validity of the analysis. A further step would be doing clustering or PCA on the personality traits, and observe the differences. However, since we have little knowledge in psychology, we won’t be able to interpret the results, so we chose not to include these. 5.5 Question 5 People’s views on climate change and environmental problems differ by the party the support. For example, supporters of the GOP tend to think that policies aimed at reducing the effect of climate change will hurt the economy, while the Democrats tend to think they have benefits. Similar trends appear in other climate and environment related issues. These association are on the individual level. If we aggregate them, we might be able to see a correlation with elections outcomes. We have Pew’s survey data about environment and climate change in 2018 and 2020, which are both election years (and the surveys are prior to elections). We used the House election data instead of Senate because all House seats but only one third of Senate seats are open for election every two years, which means there’s extra sources of variation for Senate elections. We didn’t use Presidential election because we don’t have survey data in 2016. Unfortunately, the survey data only allows for aggregation by census region (South, West, Northeast, and Midwest, each consisting of around 10 states). This means we will only have 4 data points for a year, which precludes regression and statistical tests. Nevertheless, the difference across the regions and the trends are very obvious. The four census regions are shown below. In both 2018 and 2020, we can see that if people think the government isn’t doing enough on climate and environment issues, they tend to support the Democratic party. Exceptions are animal and water protection. It seems the two are not so important. Note that the support for Democrats are calculated as the ratio of people who voted for a Democratic candidate in the census region. It’s not the average of average in each state. However, when we take the difference in the two years. It’s a different story. The trend has reversed. If more people fell the government is not doing enough on the issues, more people are voting for the GOP. What’s happening here? We should take note that from 2016 to 2018, the Republicans had majority in the House, while the Democrats took over the majority in 2018. Before elections, people are likely to blame the incumbent for not taking enough action. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion We have investigate the relationship between individual attributes and attitudes towards environmental issues. Main conclusions are the followings: Q1 and Q3: Age, income, education, and sex are related with opinions on a wide range of environmental issues such as whether human activities contribute to global climate change or whether we should have more nuclear power uses. The existence or the direction of impact can be intricately different (asymmetric) for each political party whose reasons are worth investigating further. Policy makers should pay attention to these asymmetric tendencies when they are willing to pursue environmental policies by getting support from the large society. Q2: Republicans are not only likely to attribute climate change to just a natural phenomenon but also they are less likely to observe climate change affecting their communities in the first place. Therefore, we should first review research regarding the existence of impact of climate change on our communities to start discussing environmental policies.
